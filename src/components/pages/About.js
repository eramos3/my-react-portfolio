    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, welcome to my portfolio. As you can see I'm a big sports fan, actually more of a soccer
    fan overall but, I still like to be a super-fan when it comes to LA sports. I recently started learning
    how to code, and learned some now skill like, JavaScript, Web APIs, Node.js, Object Oriented Programing, SQL/NoSql,
    PWAs, and React. I hope to someday land a job where I can put my skills to
    work. In the mean time, please feel free to check out some of my projects, I'll be adding more content
    as I improve. </p>
